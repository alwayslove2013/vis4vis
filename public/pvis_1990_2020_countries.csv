PacificVis,2020,Leveraging Peer Feedback to Improve Visualization Education,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1261,###,###,###,###,"Peer review is a widely utilized pedagogical feedback mechanism for engaging students, which has been shown to improve educational outcomes. However, we find limited discussion and empirical measurement of peer review in visualization coursework. In addition to engagement, peer review provides direct and diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts through critical evaluation of others' work. In this paper, we discuss the construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses. The results indicate that course concepts are reinforced with peer review-82\% reported learning more because of peer review, and 75\% of students recommended continuing it. Finally, we provide a road-map for adapting peer review to other visualization courses to produce more highly engaged students.",###,Zachariah Beasley;Alon Friedman;Les A.

PacificVis,2020,"Representing Multivariate Data by Optimal Colors to Uncover Events
of Interest in Time Series Data",10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.9915,###,###,###,###,"In this paper, we present a visualization system for users to study multivariate time series data. They first identify trends or anomalies from a global view and then examine details in a local view. Specifically, we train a neural network to project high-dimensional data to a two dimensional (2D) planar space while retaining global data distances. By aligning the 2D points with a predefined color map, high-dimensional data can be represented by colors. Because perceptual color differentiation may fail to reflect data distance, we optimize perceptual color differentiation on each map region by deformation. The region with large perceptual color differentiation will expand, whereas the region with small differentiation will shrink. Since colors do not occupy any space in visualization, we convey the overview of multivariate time series data by a calendar view. Cells in the view are color-coded to represent multivariate data at different time spans. Users can observe color changes over time to identify events of interest. Afterward, they study details of an event by examining parallel coordinate plots. Cells in the calendar view and the parallel coordinate plots are dynamically linked for users to obtain insights that are barely noticeable in large datasets. The experiment results, comparisons, conducted case studies, and the user study indicate that our visualization system is feasible and effective.",###,Ding{-}Bang Chen;Chien{-}Hsun Lai;Yun{-}Hsuan Lien;Yu{-}Hsuan Lin;Yu{-}Shuen Wang;Kwan{-}Liu Ma,"Chen, DB (Corresponding Author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Recent research in explainable AI has produced promising techniques to explain the inner workings of such models using feature contribution vectors. These vectors are helpful in a wide variety of applications. However, there are many parameters involved in this process and determining which settings are best is difficult due to the subjective nature of evaluating interpretability. To this end, we introduce EXPLAINEXPLORE: an interactive explanation system to explore explanations that fit the subjective preference of data scientists. We leverage the domain knowledge of the data scientist to find optimal parameter settings and instance perturbations, and enable the discussion of the model and its explanation with domain experts. We present a use case on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the exploration and tuning of machine learning explanations.",###,Dennis Collaris;Jarke J. van Wijk,"Collaris, D (Corresponding Author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.

PacificVis,2020,PansyTree: Merging Multiple Hierarchies,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1007,###,###,###,###,"Hierarchical structures are very common in the real world for recording all kinds of relational data generated in our daily life and business procedures. A very popular visualization method for displaying such data structures is called ``Tree{''}. So far, there are a variety of Tree visualization methods that have been proposed and most of them can only visualize one hierarchical dataset at a time. Hence, it raises the difficulty of comparison between two or more hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we proposed Pansy Tree which used a tree metaphor to visualize merged hierarchies. We design a unique icon named pansy to represent each merged node in the structure. Each Pansy is encoded by three colors mapping data items from three different datasets in the same hierarchical position (or tree node). The petals and sepal on Pansy are designed for showing each attribute's values and hierarchical information. We also redefine the links in force layout encoded by width and animation to better convey hierarchical information. We further apply Pansy Tree into CNCEE datasets and demonstrate two use cases to verify its effectiveness. The main contribution of this work is to merge three datasets into one tree that makes it much easier to explore and compare the structures, data items and data attributes with visual tools.",###,Yu Dong;Alex Fauth;Mao Lin Huang;Yi Chen;Jie Liang,"Dong, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

SSR-VFD is the first work that advocates a machine learning approach to generate high-resolution vector fields from low-resolution ones. The core of SSR-VFD lies in the use of three separate neural nets that take the three components of a low-resolution vector field as input and jointly output a synthesized high-resolution vector field. To capture spatial coherence, we take into account magnitude and angle losses in network optimization. Our method can work in the in situ scenario where VFD are down-sampled at simulation time for storage saving and these reduced VFD are upsampled back to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-VFD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several vector field data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation, and two solutions based on CNN and GAN, respectively.",###,Li Guo;Shaojie Ye;Jun Han;Hao Zheng;Han Gao;Danny Z.

Dynamics and LSTM-based Control Policies",10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.7127,###,###,###,###,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL), where a policy represented by a deep neural network is trained, has shown some success in playing video games and chess. However, applying RL to real-world tasks like robot control is still challenging. Because generating a massive number of samples to train control policies using RL on real robots is very expensive, hence impractical, it is common to train in simulations, and then transfer to real environments. The trained policy, however, may fail in the real world because of the difference between the training and the real environments, especially the difference in dynamics. To diagnose the problems, it is crucial for experts to understand (1) how the trained policy behaves under different dynamics settings, (2) which part of the policy affects the behaviors the most when the dynamics setting changes, and (3) how to adjust the training procedure to make the policy robust. This paper presents DynamicsExplorer, a visual analytics tool to diagnose the trained policy on robot control tasks under different dynamics settings. DynamicsExplorer allows experts to overview the results of multiple tests with different dynamics-related parameter settings so experts can visually detect failures and analyze the sensitivity of different parameters. Experts can further examine the internal activations of the policy for selected tests and compare the activations between success and failure tests. Such comparisons help experts form hypotheses about the policy and allows them to verify the hypotheses via DynamicsExplorer.

PacificVis,2020,Visualization of Unsteady Flow Using Heat Kernel Signatures,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1718,###,###,###,###,"We introduce a new technique to visualize complex flowing phenomena by using concepts from shape analysis. Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly. We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional unsteady flows.",###,Kairong Jiang;Matthew Berger;Joshua A.

PacificVis,2020,A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Streaming Performance Data,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.9280,###,###,###,###,"Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale parallel computing systems demands a streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to vast amounts of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers.",###,Suraj P.

We also present algorithms to compute the symmetry quality metrics in O(nlogn) time. We validate our symmetry quality metrics using deformation experiments. We then use the metrics to evaluate existing graph layouts to compare how faithfully they display geometric automorphisms of a graph as symmetries.",###,Amyra Meidiana;Seok{-}Hee Hong;Peter Eades;Daniel A.

To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efficient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system. Our algorithms are less computationally involved, produce smoother morphings, and require less user-defined parameter settings than existing state-of-the-art approaches.",###,Vladimir Molchanov;Sagad Hamid;Lars Linsen,"Molchanov, V (Corresponding Author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.

Analyzing these unique temporal datasets poses a significant challenge for domain experts, due to the complex and often incomplete data, for which corresponding exploratory tools are not available. In this paper, we present a novel visual analysis tool for extraction and interactive exploration of temporal measurements captured at the polar station at the James Ross Island in Antarctica. The tool allows domain experts to quickly extract information about the snow level, originating from a series of photos acquired by trail cameras. Using linked views, the domain experts can interactively explore and combine this information with other spatial and non-spatial measures, such as temperature or wind speed, to reveal the interplay of periglacial and aeolian processes. An abstracted interactive map of the area indicates the position of measurement spots to facilitate navigation. The design of the tool was made in tight collaboration with geographers, which resulted in an early prototype, tested in the pilot study. The following version of the tool and its usability has been evaluated in the user study with five domain experts and their feedback was incorporated into the final version, presented in this paper.

However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution.

We contribute a thorough analysis of potential sources of information loss involved in these techniques, which include the visual spatialization of text documents, user-steered exploration, and the visual summarization. With lessons learned from previous research, we highlight the various ways those information losses could hamper the exploration. Furthermore, we formally define measures for the aforementioned different types of information losses and bias.

In this paper, we present an approach that offers several means to analyze the plot and characters of a novel visually. Analysts can easily switch between an adjacency matrix and a node-link representation, which provide an overview of the characters and the relationships between them. Both views enable analysts to select different text ranges of the novel for studying the commonalities and differences of the character constellations within these ranges. We offer interactive visual representations to help investigate the relationships between the characters in more detail. Additionally, we link the visual representations with the novels' texts to support the inspection and verification of previously generated ideas and hypotheses.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of large sets of ligand trajectories, enabling the domain experts to understand protein function based on the trajectory properties. The proposed solution is composed of multiple linked 2D and 3D views, enabling the interactive exploration and filtering of trajectories in an informed way.

We describe how drill-down techniques can be used to create and store selections of the trajectories with desired properties, enabling the comparison of multiple datasets. In appropriately designed 2D and 3D views, biochemists can either observe individual trajectories or choose to aggregate the information into a functional boxplot or density visualization.

Given an unannotated text collection, it is difficult for users to determine what label to create and how to label the initial training set for classification. Thus, we present an interactive visual analytics system for incremental text classification based on a semi-supervised topic modeling method, modified Gibbs sampling maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (Gibbs MedLDA). Given a text collection, Gibbs MedLDA generates topics as a summary of the text collection. We design a scatter plot to display documents and topics simultaneously to show the topic information, and this helps users explore the text collection structurally and find labels for creating. After labeling documents, Gibbs MedLDA is applied to the text collection with labels again, and it generates both the topic and classification information. We also provide a scatter plot with the classifier boundary and a matrix view to present weights of classifiers. Users can iteratively label documents to refine each classifier.

In situ analysis aims at minimizing expensive data movement while maximizing the resource utilization for extraction of important information from the data. In this work, we study the evolution of rotating stall in jet engines using data generated from a large-scale flow simulation under various input conditions. Since the features of interest lack a precise descriptor, we adopt a fuzzy rule-based machine learning algorithm for efficient and robust extraction of such features. For scalable exploration, we advocate for an off-line learning and in situ prediction driven strategy that facilitates in-depth study of the stall.

The conventional visual mapping maps each data attribute onto a single visual channel (e.g., the year of production of a car to the position on the horizontal axis). In this work, we investigate composite visual mapping: mapping single data attributes onto several visual channels, each one representing one aspect of the data attribute (e.g., its order of magnitude, or its trend component). We first propose a table which allows us to explore the design space of composite mappings by offering a systematic overview of channel combinations. We expect that using more than one visual channel for communicating a data attribute increases the bandwidth of information presentation by displaying separable information on different aspects of data. In order to evaluate this point, we compare horizon graph, an existing technique which successfully adopts a composite visual mapping, with a selection of alternative composite mappings. We show that some of those mappings perform as well as - and in some cases even better than-horizon graph in terms of accuracy and speed.

By combining these three components, which aim at the analysis of simulation ensembles of such molecules, and complementing them with a space-time representation that enables detailed interactive inspection of individual simulations, we obtain a versatile tool for the analysis of the fragmentation of structured, symmetrical molecules such as fullerenes. We exemplify the utility of our approach using a tightly coupled simulation approach for the dynamics of fullerenes.",###,Kai Sdeo;Bastian Rieck;Filip Sadlo,"Sdeo, K (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.

PacificVis,2018,Topologically Controlled Lossy Compression,10.1109/PacificVis.2018.00015,###,###,###,###,"This paper presents a new algorithm for the lossy compression of scalar data defined on 2D or 3D regular grids, with topological control. Certain techniques allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However, in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation of higher-level notions, such as topological features, in order to provide guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or acquired data sets.

PacificVis,2018,Optimal Algorithms for Compact Linear Layouts,10.1109/PacificVis.2018.00010,###,###,###,###,"Linear layouts are a simple and natural way to draw a graph: all vertices are placed on a single line and edges are drawn as arcs between the vertices. Despite its simplicity, a linear layout can be a very meaningful visualization if there is a particular order defined on the vertices. Common examples of such ordered-and often also directed-graphs are event sequences and processes. A main drawback of linear layouts are the usually (very) large aspect ratios of the resulting drawings, which prevent users from obtaining a good overview of the whole graph. In this paper we present a novel and versatile algorithm to optimally fold a linear layout of a graph such that it can be drawn effectively in a specified aspect ratio, while still clearly communicating the linearity of the layout. Our algorithm allows vertices to be drawn as blocks or rectangles of specified sizes to incorporate different drawing styles, label sizes, and even recursive structures. For reasonably-sized drawings the folded layout can be computed interactively. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on graphs that represent process trees, a particular type of process model.

Any approach to view and analyze these datasets on post analysis machines will have to effectively address the inevitable problem of data loss. Image based approaches are well suited for handling very large datasets on low cost platforms. Three challenges with these approaches are how to effectively represent the original data with minimal data loss, analyze the data in regards to transfer function exploration, which is a key analysis tool, and quantify the error from data loss during analysis. We present a novel image based approach using distributions to preserve data integrity. At each view sample, view dependent data is summarized at each pixel with distributions to define a compact proxy for the original dataset.

Instead of static data assignment, we dynamically repartition the data into blocks and reassign the blocks to processes to balance the workload distribution among the processes. Block repartitioning is performed based on a dynamic workload estimation method that predicts the workload in the flow field on the fly as the input. In our approach, we allow data duplication in the repartitioning, enabling the same data blocks to be assigned to multiple processes. Load balance is achieved by regularly exchanging the blocks (together with the particles in the blocks) among processes according to the output of the data repartitioning. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms, our approach does not need any preprocessing on the raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently.

Our design minimizes the data movement and storage, maximizes the resource utilization, and reduces the slowdown of the simulation.

Exploring scalar uncertain data modeled as probability distribution fields is a challenging task because the underlying features are often more complex, and the data associated with each grid point are high dimensional. In this work, we present a compact and effective representation, called range likelihood tree, to summarize and explore probability distribution fields. The key idea is to decompose and summarize each complex probability distribution over a few representative subranges by cumulative probabilities, and allow users to consider the roles that different subranges play in understanding the probability distributions. In our method, the value domain is first partitioned into subranges, then the distribution at each grid point is transformed according to the cumulative probabilities of the point's distribution in those subranges. Organizing the subranges into a hierarchical structure based on how these cumulative probabilities are spatially distributed in the grid points, the new range likelihood tree representation allows effective classification and identification of features through user query and exploration. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore probability distribution fields, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework.

With DC, users can weigh the relative travel time costs between the origin and potential destinations at a glance because travel times are projected in a linearly interpolated time space from the origin. Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions introduce excessive distortion and challenge user intuition. In addition, there has been little research focusing on DC's user interaction design. To tackle these challenges and realize the potential of DC as an interactive decision-making support tool, we derive a set of useful interactions through two formative studies and devise two novel techniques called Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection and Scalable Road-network Construction. We develop an interactive map system using these techniques and evaluate this system by comparing it against an equidistant map (EM), a widely used conventional layout that preserves the geographical reality.

A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels.

Compared to univariate datasets, analysis and visualization of multivariate datasets are much more challenging due to the complex relationships among the variables. As an effective way to visualize and analyze multivariate datasets, volume rendering has been frequently used, although designing good multivariate transfer functions is still non-trivial. In this paper, we present an interactive workflow to allow users to design multivariate transfer functions. To handle large scale datasets, in the preprocessing stage we reduce the number of data points through data binning and aggregation, and then a new set of data points with a much smaller size are generated. The relationship between all pairs of variables is presented in a matrix juxtaposition view, where users can navigate through the different subspaces. An entropy based method is used to help users to choose which subspace to explore. We proposed two weights: scatter weight and size weight that are associated with each projected point in those different subspaces. Based on those two weights, data point filter and kernel density estimation operations are employed to assist users to discover interesting features. For each user-selected feature, a Gaussian function is constructed and updated incrementally. Finally, all those selected features are visualized through multivariate volume rendering to reveal the structure of data.

This labeling technique is known as external label placement. In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions of the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatie analysis of 202 handmade anatomieal drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance.

Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) is extremely important for safe and precision medicine. There are various machine learning based approaches to predict adverse reactions for drugs. These models, though effective, lack biological interpretation and are treated as black-boxes. We propose DrugPathSeeker, a novel interactive user interface that integrates the machine learning model, database query API, statistical analysis, and visualization for exploring and understanding of the association between drugs and ADRs. The proposed UI can take a query drug, and provide a visual interface designed to support exploration of the predictions from the machine learning model for further understanding and interpretation. DrugPathSeeker uses a machine learning model, Small Molecular Risk Profiler, to make ADR predictions for a given drug. The visualization uses Sankey type flow diagrams for highlighting the relation between the drugs and ADRs. The main goal of DrugPathSeeker is to mine the gene-pathways from public databases and analyze them in a visual manner to generate a biological hypothesis.

A daunting challenge is to analyze and visualize these intractable datasets on commodity hardware. A recent and promising area of research is to replace the dataset with a distribution based proxy representation that summarizes scalar information into a much reduced memory footprint. Proposed representations subdivide the dataset into local blocks, where each block holds important statistical information, such as a histogram. A key drawback is that a distribution representing the scalar values in a block lacks spatial information. This manifests itself as large errors in visualization algorithms. We present a novel statistically-based representation by augmenting the block-wise distribution based representation with location information, called a value-based spatial distribution. Information from both spatial and scalar spaces are combined using Bayes' rule to accurately estimate the data value at a given spatial location. The representation is compact using the Gaussian Mixture Model.

The study entails understanding the state of the Earth's atmosphere, how it is changing over time and why. Understanding how various weather events develop and evolve is often conducted through retrospective analysis of past atmospheric events. Atmospheric scientists can then utilize tools to better predict potential hazards and provide earlier warnings for events that may impact life and property. Several atmospheric state variables can be measured to identify high-impact events, one of which is surface atmospheric pressure. Many weather events are characterized by variations in surface pressure from the mean pressure value (i.e., pressure-perturbations). Accordingly, there is significant interest in extracting and tracking pressure-perturbations both spatially and temporally to better understand the evolution of weather events. Here, we present a visualization and analysis environment that allows interactive exploration of pressure-perturbation data sets. Our system, for the first time, enables atmospheric scientists to interactively explore the spatiotemporal behaviors of pressure-perturbations for a range of values and provides support to leverage other conventional data sets such as radar imagery and wind observations. It also allows atmospheric scientists to evaluate model and parameter sensitivity, which is difficult if not impossible with conventional visualization tools in atmospheric sciences.

Therefore, an efficient approach to identifying feature subspaces of target datasets, that is, the subspaces of dimension variables or subsets of the data samples, is required to describe the essence hidden in the original dataset. This paper proposes a visual data mining framework for supporting semiautomatic data analysis that builds upon asymmetric biclustering to explore highly correlated feature subspaces. For this purpose, a variant of parallel coordinate plots, many-to-many parallel coordinate plots, is extended to visually assist appropriate selections of feature subspaces as well as to avoid intrinsic visual clutter. In this framework, biclustering is applied to dimension variables and data samples of the dataset simultaneously and asymmetrically. A set of variable axes are projected to a single composite axis while data samples between two consecutive variable axes are bundled using polygonal strips. This makes the visualization method scalable and enables it to play a key role in the framework.

In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas.

For instance, any new insight into the mechanisms of ionic migration in catalytic materials could lead to a substantial increase in battery performance.

The relative-angle distribution can be represented as a collection of 1D histograms, but is currently created in a slow, offline process, making any parameter exploration a tedious and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the resulting plot can hide uncertainty in both the data and the visualization. As a result, once rastered or printed at a fixed resolution, these histograms can be misleading. We present a new analysis tool for the exploration of atomic trajectories that combines an interactive histogram visualization with uncertainty information for both data and plotting errors, and is also linked to an interactive 3D display of trajectories.

Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research.

Arc length based aspect ratio selection (AL) has demonstrated many empirical advantages over previous methods. However, it is still not clear why and when this method works.

First, we explain the rationale why this method is parameterization invariant and follow the same rationale to extend previous methods which are not parameterization invariant. As such, we propose maximizing weighted local curvature (MLC), a parameterization invariant form of local orientation resolution (LOR) and reveal the theoretical connection between average slope (AS) and resultant vector (RV). Furthermore, we establish a mathematical connection between AL and banking to 45 degrees and derive the upper and lower bounds of its average absolute slopes. Finally, we conduct a quantitative comparison that revises the understanding of aspect ratio selection methods in three aspects: (1) showing that AL, AWO and RV always perform very similarly while MS is not; (2) demonstrating the advantages in the robustness of RV over AL; (3) providing a counterexample where all previous methods produce poor results while MLC works well.",###,Fubo Han;Yunhai Wang;Jian Zhang;Oliver Deussen;Baoquan Chen,"Han, FB (Corresponding Author), Shandong Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.

As a result, it is challenging for analysts to detect the correlation of individual layers and their aggregation, and find trend similarities and differences between layers solely with stacked graphs. In this paper, we study the correlations of individual layers, and their aggregation in time series data presented with stacked graphs, focusing on the local regions within any given time intervals.

In this work, we propose a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduce spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using point-based methods. We use four existing local vortex detectors and convert their outputs into fuzzy possibility values using a sigmoid-based soft-thresholding approach.

Although using uniformly down-sampled data for visualization is a common practice, important information in the un-stored data can be lost. Currently, linear interpolation is a popular method used to approximate data between the stored time steps. For pathline computation, however, errors from the interpolated velocity in the time dimension can accumulate quickly and make the trajectories rather unreliable. To inform the scientist the error involved in the visualization, it is important to quantify and display the uncertainty, and more importantly, to reduce the error whenever possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm to model temporal interpolation error, and an error reduction scheme to improve the data accuracy for temporally down-sampled data. We show that it is possible to compute polynomial regression and measure the interpolation errors incrementally with one sequential scan of the time-varying flow field. We also show empirically that when the data sequence is fitted with least-squares regression, the errors can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution.

However, the data sets resulting from mobile measurements are complex: They are spatially dependent, multivariate, and often-times multitemporal. At the same time, the spatial context of each observation -its field of view and area represented - is physically complex and dynamic. These properties make analysis and visualization challenging. We present a prototype visualization framework that assists researchers in the analysis of mobile transect measurements. The system enables users to visualize and explore observations as walls that delineate the transect route on a map. The observed attributes are stacked upon each other within these walls as ribbons to facilitate the qualitative analysis of spatial variability and multivariate correlations. The relationship between observations and spatial context can interactively be explored by moving a slider along the transect route. For each observation on the track, the spatially contextual source area is displayed and linked to a view of the fraction of land cover classes contained within the source area. These qualitative analysis capabilities are complemented by an interactive clustering interface, which allows for the classification of transect segments according to a coherent pattern of multivariate relationships between a user-defined set of observations.

The proposed algorithm is a novel object-based approach which eliminates many of the shortcomings of state-of-the-art image-based DoF algorithms. Based on observations derived from a physically-correct reference renderer, coverage-based opacity estimation exploits semi-transparency to simulate the blur inherent to DoF effects. It achieves high quality DoF effects, by augmenting each atom with a semi-transparent shell, which has a radius proportional to the distance from the focal plane of the camera. Thus, each shell represents an additional coverage area whose opacity varies radially, based on our observations derived from the results of multi-sampling DoF algorithms. By using the proposed technique, it becomes possible to generate high quality visual results, comparable to those achieved through ground-truth multi-sampling algorithms. At the same time, we obtain a significant speedup which is essential for visualizing MD data as it enables interactive rendering. In this paper, we derive the underlying theory, introduce coverage-based opacity estimation and demonstrate how it can be applied to real world MD data in order to achieve DoF effects.

High-level language constructs can simplify programming many-core devices, but this ease comes with a potential loss of processing power, particularly for cross-platform constructs. Recently, scientific visualization packages have embraced language constructs centering around data parallelism, with familiar operators such as map, reduce, gather, and scatter. Complete adoption of data parallelism will require that central visualization algorithms be revisited, and expressed in this new paradigm while preserving both functionality and performance. This investment has a large potential payoff: portable performance in software bases that can span over the many architectures that scientific visualization applications run on. With this work, we present a method for ray tracing consisting of entirely of data parallel primitives. Given the extreme computational power on nodes now prevalent on supercomputers, we believe that ray tracing can supplant rasterization as the work-horse graphics solution for scientific visualization. Our ray tracing method is relatively efficient, and we describe its performance with a series of tests, and also compare to leading-edge ray tracers that are optimized for specific platforms.

CloudGazer is a multiple coordinated view system that visualizes either static or live status information about the components of a perspective while reintroducing lost inter-perspective relationships on demand using dynamically created inlays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudGazer in two usage scenarios: The first is based on a real-world network of our domain partners where static performance parameters are used to find an optimal design. In the second scenario we use the VAST 2013 Challenge dataset to demonstrate how the system can be employed with live streaming data.",###,Holger Stitz;Samuel Gratzl;Michael T.

It is known that spatial comprehension can be further improved by incorporating multiple light sources. However, many volumetric illumination algorithms have severe drawbacks when dealing with multiple light sources. These drawbacks are mainly high performance penalties and memory usage, which can be tackled with specialized data structures or data under sampling. In contrast, in this paper we present a method which enables volumetric illumination with multiple light sources without requiring precomputation or impacting visual quality.

The approach has been maximally automated in the sense that highly-correlated dimensions are automatically grouped to form subspaces, which effectively supports further exploration of them. A key idea behind our approach lies in a new mathematical formulation of asymmetric biclustering, by combining spherical k-means clustering for grouping highly-correlated dimensions, together with ordinary k-means clustering for identifying subsets of data samples.

We propose a novel method based on Voronoi treemap to encode each community with a polygon and the relative positions of polygons encode their relational strengths. Different community attributes can be encoded by polygon shapes, sizes and colors. A corner-cutting method is further introduced to adjust the smoothness of polygons based on certain community attribute. To accommodate the boundary nodes, the gaps between the polygons are widened by a polygon-shrinking algorithm such that the boundary nodes can be conveniently embedded into the newly created spaces. The method is very efficient, enabling users to test different community detection algorithms, fine tune the results, and explore the fuzzy relations between communities interactively.

The mean shift algorithm is applied to get centers of probability density to segment the histogram, and then the dimension can be extended according to the number of segments of the histogram.

In this paper, we propose to use moment invariants as pattern descriptors for flow fields. Moment invariants are one of the most popular techniques for the description of objects in the field of image recognition. They have recently also been applied to identify 2D vector patterns limited to the directional properties of flow fields. In contrast to previous work, we follow the intuitive approach of moment normalization, which results in a complete and independent set of translation, rotation, and scaling invariant flow field descriptors.

Distribution based data summaries can substitute for the raw data to answer statistical queries of different kinds.

Our work addresses the issue by accelerating range distribution query, which returns the distribution of an axis-aligned query region. Maintaining the interactivity of such query is a challenging task because the workload and the response time of such queries scale up with the data and the query size. In this paper, we present a framework for answering range distribution queries for any arbitrary region in near constant time, regardless of data and query size. We adapt an integral histogram based data structure to bound the workload which is a combination of computation, I/O and communication cost.

Standard approaches show difference between DTI models in 3D space, with either voxel-based or fiber based comparison. We proposes a new method that embeds a high-dimensional 3D fiber model as a continuous map in a 2D normalized space, built on fibers from all targeted fiber models. One advantage over previous 2D embedding approaches is that our method represents all fiber models in a unified coordinate system by taking a cluster-andproject routine, ensuring that closely located fibers from different models will be projected to close points on the 2D map. Using this projected 2D map, subtle differences that are difficult to distinguish in 3D space can be clearly displayed and individual fiber model can be effectively summarized.

This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability- based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists.

Visualisation of Dense Graphs",10.1109/PacificVis.2014.46,###,###,###,###,"Drawings of highly connected (dense) graphs can be very difficult to read. Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method.

These drawings are so widely known that they are immediately recognizable to most biologists. This enables collaborative work and simplifies the communication of analysis results. Automatic layout of these pathway maps is complicated by the fact that the information available from KEGG does not contain the entire layout information of the reference maps. Here we present a fully automated algorithm for interactive KEGG layout construction. The algorithm conserves the original KEGG layout to the extent possible while improving readability by removing unnecessary elements (in organism-specific maps).

We use two basic operations to iteratively replace consecutive arcs until the desired complexity is reached. Our results are not restricted to arcs ending at input vertices. The method can be steered towards different degrees of ``curviness{''}: we can encourage or discourage the use of arcs with a large central angle via a single parameter. Our method creates visually pleasing results even for very low output complexities. We conducted an online user study investigating the effectiveness of the curved schematizations compared to straight-line schematizations of equivalent complexity. While the visual complexity of the curved shapes was judged higher than those using straight lines, users generally preferred curved schematizations.

Finally, we design a tour that traverses all selected viewpoints in a smooth and efficient manner for visual navigation and exploration of the flow field.

PacificVis,2014,A Stochastic Approach for Rendering Multiple Irregular Volumes,10.1109/PacificVis.2014.26,###,###,###,###,"In this paper, we propose a technique for rendering multiple irregular volumes using a stochastic approach. In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell. The particle spacing follows the exponential distribution. In this case, we construct a cumulative distribution function of the particle spacing and develop a technique for calculating the nearest particle along the interval. We apply this technique to multiple volumes to confirm its effectiveness.",###,Naohisa Sakamoto;Koji Koyamada,"Sakamoto, N (Corresponding Author), Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.

The partition is maintained and updated while the objects move. We use examples from the maritime domain, but our method is applicable to a wider range of dynamic data.

Most existing simplification techniques based on the topological skeleton successively remove pairs of critical points connected by separatrices, using distance or area-based relevance measures. These methods rely on the stable extraction of the topological skeleton, which can be difficult due to instability in numerical integration, especially when processing highly rotational flows. These geometric metrics do not consider the flow magnitude, an important physical property of the flow. In this paper, we propose a novel simplification scheme derived from the recently introduced topological notion of robustness, which provides a complementary view on flow structure compared to the traditional topologicalskeleton-based approaches. Robustness enables the pruning of sets of critical points according to a quantitative measure of their stability, that is, the minimum amount of vector field perturbation required to remove them. This leads to a hierarchical simplification scheme that encodes flow magnitude in its perturbation metric. Our novel simplification algorithm is based on degree theory, has fewer boundary restrictions, and so can handle more general cases.

In this paper, we introduce FlowString, a novel approach that extracts shape invariant features from streamlines and utilizes a string-based method for exploratory streamline analysis and visualization. Our solution first resamples streamlines by considering their local feature scales. We then classify resampled points along streamlines based on the shape similarity around their local neighborhoods. We encode each streamline into a string of well-selected shape characters, from which we construct meaningful words for querying and retrieval. A unique feature of our approach is that it captures intrinsic streamline similarity that is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Leveraging the suffix tree, we enable efficient search of streamline patterns with arbitrary lengths with the complexity linear to the size of the respective pattern. We design an intuitive interface and user interactions to support flexible querying, allowing exact and approximate searches for robust partial streamline similarity matching. Users can perform queries at either the character level or the word level, and define their own characters or words conveniently for customized search.

Our system enables the interactive selection of variables that are highly correlated to fish catches recorded by fishermen on their vessels. We illustrate the use of this system using a real-world simulation of the Pacific Ocean. Vortex structures, such as those used for fishing grounds exploration, are crucial for exploring fishing ground because they can drive nutrients from the ocean floor to the sea surface. The ability to locate fishing grounds therefore depends on accurate ocean forecasting systems for calculating ocean model variables such as temperature, salinity, velocity etc. Currently, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations that produce multidimensional and multivariate results. Critical points in the ocean model are good indicators of the likelihood of finding microscale vortices, and our visualization approach enables the interactive exploration and analysis of these critical points. The proposed system makes it possible to analyze the vortex structure in the spatial domain, and explore fishing grounds on the sea surface in detail.",###,Takashi Uenaka;Naohisa Sakamoto;Koji Koyamada,"Uenaka, T (Corresponding Author), Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.

Reinforced Polymers",10.1109/PacificVis.2014.52,###,###,###,###,"Advanced composites such as fiber reinforced polymers are promising candidate materials for future components as they allow integrating the continuously rising demands of industry regarding cost-effectiveness, function-orientation, integration and weight. The most important structures of fiber reinforced polymers are the individual fibers, as their characteristics (stiffness, strength, ductility, durability, etc.) to a large extent determine the properties of the final component. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new system for interactive exploration and visual analysis of fiber properties in X-ray computed tomography data of fiber reinforced polymers. The presented tool uses parallel coordinates to define and configure initial fiber classes. Using a scatter plot matrix linked to the parallel coordinates the initial classification may be refined. This allows to analyze hidden relationships between individual fiber properties. 2D and 3D views depict the resulting fiber classifications. By using polar plots an intuitive rendering of the fiber orientation distribution is provided. In addition, two modules of higher abstraction are proposed: The Blob visualization creates a hull around fibers with similar characteristics. The fiber metadata visualization allows to calculate overlays for 2D and 3D views containing regional information of particular material characteristics. The proposed system has been evaluated by two groups of domain experts. Applying the presented concepts the user feedback shows that the domain experts are now able to efficiently perform tasks as classification of fibers, visualization of fiber lengths and orientations, and visualization of fiber regions. The insights gained can be forwarded to the design office as well as to material development and simulation, in order to speed up the development of novel composite components.",###,"Johannes Weissenbock;Artem Amirkhanov;Weimin Li;Andreas Reh;Alexander Amirkhanov;M.

Parallel-coordinates plots supplement this visualization scenario by providing statistical analysis of the geometry for distinct pairs of co-dimensions. Such analysis results in visual signatures that embed geometric structures such as symmetry, and thus allows us to overview the status of the missing dimensions while exploring the projected geometry. This paper presents a blue-noise sampling approach for efficient construction of continuous parallel-coordinates plots of high-dimensional geometric surfaces defined by mathematical equations. We employ the parallel-coordinates plots with the embedded visual signatures to assist the interactive exploration of high-dimensional geometries, typically for 2-manifold embedded in 4-space. While we interactively explore the 3D projected geometry, we can observe dynamic changes on its visual signature. Various geometric properties can also be identified and visualized.

The main challenge is to find an association that allows a user to find a region in the grid quickly. We call the representation of a set of regions as a grid a grid map. We introduce a new approach to solve the association problem for grid maps by formulating it as a point set matching problem: Given two sets A (the centroids of the regions) and B (the grid centres) of n points in the plane, compute an optimal one-to-one matching between A and B. We identify three optimisation criteria that are important for grid map layout: maximise the number of adjacencies in the grid that are also adjacencies of the regions, minimise the sum of the distances between matched points, and maximise the number of pairs of points in A for which the matching preserves the directional relation (SW, NW, etc.). We consider matchings that minimise the L-1-distance (Manhattan-distance), the ranked L-1 -distance, and the L-2(2) -distance, since one can expect that minimising distances implicitly helps to fulfill the other criteria. We present algorithms to compute such matchings and perform an experimental comparison that also includes a previous method to compute a grid map.

However, the ability to perform cost-effective data querying and indexing is often not incorporated, which posts a serious limitation as the size of timevarying data continue to grow. In this paper, we present a new approach that unifies data compacting, indexing and classification into a single framework. We achieve this by transforming the timeactivity curve representation of a time-varying data set into a hierarchical symbolic representation. We further build an indexable version of the data hierarchy, from which we create the iTree for visual representation of the time-varying data. A hyperbolic layout algorithm is employed to draw the iTree with a large number of nodes and provide focus+ context visualization for interaction. We achieve effective querying, searching and tracking of time-varying data sets by enabling multiple coordinated views consisting of the iTree, the symbolic view and the spatial view.",###,Yi Gu;Chaoli Wang,"Gu, Y (Corresponding Author), Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

This paper presents a novel approach to disoccluding important geographic features when creating 3D urban maps for enhancing their visual readability. This is accomplished by formulating the design criteria as a constrained optimization problem based on the linear programming approach.

Instead of only merging nodes and edges that are exactly the same, we use domain-specific comparison functions to collapse similar nodes and edges which allows us to generate more compact representations of the collection.

Our approach works with any seeding strategies as long as the domain is well covered and important flow features are captured.

The FlowGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts streamline clusters and spatial regions in various levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides flow field exploration and understanding.

Past works in online analytical processing and visualization have addressed this problem within application-specific contexts, but have not generalized their solutions to a wider variety of visualization applications. We propose a general framework for reducing the working set complexity of the interactive portion of visualization workflows that can be built on top of distribution range queries, as well as a technique within this framework able to support multiple visualization applications. Transformations are applied in the preprocessing phase of the workflow to enable fast, approximate volumetric distribution range queries with low working set complexity.

In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts.

PacificVis,2012,The mental map and memorability in dynamic graphs,10.1109/PacificVis.2012.6183578,###,###,###,###,"In dynamic graph drawing, preserving the mental map, or ensuring that the location of nodes do not change significantly as the information evolves over time is considered an important property by algorithm designers. Many prior experiments have attempted to verify this principle, with surprisingly little success. These experiments have used several different algorithmic methods, a variety of graph interpretation questions on both real and fabricated data, and different presentation methods. However, none of the results have conclusively demonstrated the importance of mental map preservation on task performance. Our experiment measures the efficacy of the dynamic graph drawing in a different manner: we look at how memorable the evolving graph is, rather than how easy it is to interpret. As observed in the previous studies, we found no significant difference in terms of response time or error rate when preserving the mental map.

We present a line predicate approach that sorts precalculated integral lines, which capture the complete flow dynamics, into bundles with similar properties. We introduce several streamline and pathline predicates that allow to structure the flow according to various features useful for blood flow analysis, such as, e. g., velocity distribution, vortices, and flow paths.

Because of the increasing discrepancy between the speed of processors and storage devices, the cost of I/O becomes a major bottleneck for out-of-core computation. To reduce the I/O cost, loading data with better spatial locality has proved to be effective. It is also known that sequential file access is more efficient. To facilitate efficient streamline computation, we propose to reorganize the data blocks in a file following the data access pattern so that more efficient I/O and effective prefetching can be accomplished. To achieve the goal, we divide the domain into small spatial blocks and order the blocks into a linear layout based on the underlying flow directions. The ordering is done using a weighted directed graph model which can be formulated as a linear graph arrangement problem. Our goal is to arrange the file in a way consistent with the data access pattern during streamline computation. This allows us to prefetch a contiguous segment of data at a time from disk and minimize the memory cache miss rate. We use a recursive partitioning method to approximate the optimal layout. Our experimental results show that the resulting file layout reduces I/O cost and hence enables more efficient out-of-core streamline computation.",###,Chun{-}Ming Chen;Lijie Xu;Teng{-}Yok Lee;Han{-}Wei Shen,"Chen, CM (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

To avoid inconsistencies or color blur during the user interactions in the image-space approach, some methods use surface parameterization or 3D volume texture for the effect of smooth transition, which often require expensive computational or memory cost. Furthermore, those methods cannot achieve consistent LIC results in both granularity and color distribution on different scales. This paper introduces a novel image-space LIC for surface flows that preserves the texture coherence during user interactions. To make the noise textures under different viewpoints coherent, we propose a simple texture mapping technique that is local, robust and effective. Meanwhile, our approach pre-computes a sequence of mipmap noise textures in a coarse-to-fine manner, leading to consistent transition when the model is zoomed. Prior to perform LIC in the image space, the mipmap noise textures are mapped onto each triangle with randomly assigned texture coordinates. Then, a standard image-space LIC based on the projected vector fields is performed to generate the flow texture. The proposed approach is simple and very suitable for GPU acceleration.

We use piecewise approximations to dynamically sample in transfer function space between world-space samples. As with unidimensional peak finding, this approach is useful for specifying transfer functions with greater precision, and for accurately rendering noisy volume data at lower sampling rates.

For its computation, several numerical methods have been introduced, which provide trade-offs between performance and accuracy. In order to decide which methods and parameter settings are suitable for a particular application, an evaluation of the different FTLE methods is necessary. We propose a general benchmark for FTLE computation, which consists of a number of 2D time-dependent flow fields and error measures. Evaluating the accuracy of a numerically computed FTLE field requires a ground truth, which is not available for realistic flow data sets, since such fields can generally not be described in a closed form. To overcome this, we introduce approaches to create non-trivial vector fields with a closed-form formulation of the FTLE field. Using this, we introduce a set of benchmark flow data sets that resemble relevant geometric aspects of Lagrangian structures, but have an analytic solution for FTLE. Based on this ground truth, we perform a comparative evaluation of three standard FTLE concepts.

with velocity based methods",10.1109/PacificVis.2012.6183573,###,###,###,###,"The formation of cosmic structure results from the action of gravity on matter in an expanding Universe. As the evolution proceeds, the velocity field changes from being single-valued almost everywhere in space to being multi-valued over a complex web of `multistreaming' regions associated with the formation of large-scale structure (LSS) such as halos (or clumps), filaments, and sheets. Until recently, these structures have been investigated primarily via the (scalar) mass density field. In this application paper we apply data analysis and visualization techniques to cosmological simulations with the aim of studying multi streaming regions using velocity-based probes. Compared to the current practice of using density information (e. g., morphology estimators, locating overdense regions with halo finders), we show that velocity-based methods can provide useful supporting, as well as complementary, information. Because the density field and multistreaming are correlated but do not contain the same information, new and interesting information about the properties of the large-scale structure may be extracted, e. g., capturing dynamical behavior not possible with density-based estimators. Incorporating a novel method for setting thresholds for the velocity-based estimators, we study the relationships between the density field as represented by compact overdense halos and the different properties of multistreaming regions as represented by different velocity-based estimators.",###,Uliana Popov;Eddy Chandra;Katrin Heitmann;Salman Habib;James P.

Our algorithm constructs an APAP surface by deforming a seed surface anchored in a domain point. In the discrete setting this minimization results in iteratively solving linear least-squares problems and integrating a locally scaled version of the vector field. The definition of the error metric and its numerical minimization guarantee that the minimum zero is attained for the perfectly perpendicular surface if it exists. Otherwise, the minimization converges to the same local minimum independent of the seed configuration, and the resulting surface is - in a least-squares sense - as perpendicular as possible to the flow.

In our network interface, the dimensions form nodes that are connected by a network of edges representing the strength of association between dimensions. A user then interactively specifies nodes/edges to visit, and the system computes an optimal route, which can be further edited and manipulated. In our interface, this route is captured by a parallel coordinate data display in which the dimension ordering is configured by the specified route.

Many analysis techniques rely on computing streamlines, a task often hampered by numerical instabilities. Approaches that ignore the resulting errors can lead to inconsistencies that may produce unreliable visualizations and ultimately prevent in-depth analysis. We propose a new representation for vector fields on surfaces that replaces numerical integration through triangles with linear maps defined on its boundary. This representation, called edge maps, is equivalent to computing all possible streamlines at a user defined error threshold. In spite of this error, all the streamlines computed using edge maps will be pairwise disjoint. Furthermore, our representation stores the error explicitly, and thus can be used to produce more informative visualizations. Given a piecewise-linear interpolated vector field, a recent result {[}15] shows that there are only 23 possible map classes for a triangle, permitting a concise description of flow behaviors.

We present a sampling-based approach to classifying correlation patterns. Our sampling scheme consists of three steps: selecting important samples from the volume, prioritizing distance computation for sample pairs, and approximating volume-based correlation with sample-based correlation. We classify sample voxels to produce static visualization that succinctly summarize the connection among all correlation volumes with respect to various reference locations.

Although it provides an intuitive way to inspect the overall structure of objects of interest, an in-detail inspection can be tedious - or when cavities occur even impossible. Therefore we propose a context-aware navigation technique for the exploration of volumetric data. While navigation techniques for polygonal data require information about the rendered geometry, this strategy is not sufficient in the area of volume rendering. Since rendering parameters, e. g., the transfer function, have a strong influence on the visualized structures, they also affect the features to be explored. To compensate for this effect we propose a novel image-based navigation approach for volumetric data. While being intuitive to use, the proposed technique allows the user to perform complex navigation tasks, in particular to get an overview as well as to perform an in-detail inspection without any navigation mode switches. The technique can be easily integrated into ray-casting based volume renderers, needs no extra data structures and is independent of the data set as well as the rendering parameters.

Some application domains have developed special visual metaphors to only represent the relevant information of such data sets but these approaches typically require detailed domain knowledge that might not always be available or applicable.

Planning of the reservoir valorization usually starts with creating a model of the subsurface structures, including seismic faults and horizons. However, seismic interpretation and horizon tracing is a difficult and error-prone task, often resulting in hours of work needing to be manually repeated. In this paper, we propose a novel, interactive workflow for horizon interpretation based on well positions, which include additional geological and geophysical data captured by actual drillings. Instead of interpreting the volume slice-by-slice in 2D, we propose 3D seismic interpretation based on well positions. We introduce a combination of 2D and 3D minimal cost path and minimal cost surface tracing for extracting horizons with very little user input. By processing the volume based on well positions rather than slice-based, we are able to create a piecewise optimal horizon surface at interactive rates. We have integrated our system into a visual analysis platform which supports multiple linked views for fast verification, exploration and analysis of the extracted horizons.

An entropy field in the form of a three dimensional volume is extracted from the input vector field. To utilize this view-independent complexity measure for view-dependent calculations, we introduce the notion of a maximal entropy projection (MEP) framebuffer, which stores maximal entropy values as well as the corresponding depth values for a given viewpoint. With this information, we develop a view-dependent streamline selection algorithm that can evaluate and choose streamlines that will cause minimum occlusion to regions of higher importance.

To study whether group size impacts the collective understanding of relationships in three-dimensional (3D) spatial structures when using different types of presentation, we carried out three experiments. We compared individual performance at structure understanding tasks to performance of groups containing two or four members. We consider two alternate visualization techniques for extracting 3D structure information: a 3D view with animated rotations and a combination of one static 3D plus three static two-dimensional (2D) projection views. In general our studies suggest that as group size increases, so does accuracy but with a cost in efficiency. Our results also suggest that beyond a threshold limit in group size, performance on certain tasks begins to degrade.

So far, density maps have mainly been used to visualize single attributes. Density maps are created in a two-way procedure; first smoothed trajectories are aggregated in a density field, and then the density field is visualized. In our approach, the user can explore attributes along trajectories by calculating a density field for multiple subsets of the data. These density fields are then either combined into a new density field or first visualized and then combined. Using a widget, called a distribution map, the user can interactively define subsets in an effective and intuitive way, and, supported by high-end graphics hardware the user gets fast feedback for these computationally expensive density field calculations. We show the versatility of our method with use cases in the maritime domain: to distinguish between periods in the temporal aggregation, to find anomalously behaving vessels, to solve ambiguities in density maps via drill down in the data, and for risk assessments.

The combination of these shading effects provides an informative global analysis of overall fluid flow. Computational solutions for these methods have proven too complex until recently due to the fundamental physical interaction of light refracting through the flow field.

We provide a case study on the magnitude scale M-w, 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds.

Such methods require constant monitoring by an operator who observes the 3D body motion via its 21) projection onto an ultrasound imaging plane and studies the synchronism of this motion with the respiratory signal. Keeping an attentive eye on the respiratory signal as well as the ultrasound video for the entire treatment period is often inconvenient and burdensome. In this paper, we propose a video visualization technique called Cycle Stack Plot which reduces this cognitive overhead by blending the video and the signal together in a stack-like layout. This visualization reveals the inherent synchronism between the target's movement and the respiratory signal, visually highlights significant phase shifts of either of the two cyclic phenomena, with the hope of arresting the operator's attention. Our proposed visualization also provides a visual overview for the post-treatment analysis which enables educated users to quickly and effectively skim through the excessively long process. This paper demonstrates the utility of CycleStack Plot with a case study using real ultrasound videos. In addition, a user study has been performed to evaluate the merits and limitations of the proposed method with respect to the conventional way of watching a video and a signal side-by-side.

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multi- pie pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions.

Color is believed to be the most dominant channel with lightness regarded as the most important one of three color dimensions. We study lightness perception in scatterplots in the context of analytic tasks requiring symbol discrimination. More specifically, we performed an experiment to measure human performance in three visual analytic tasks. Outlined circles and unframed spots, equally sized, with a uniform luminance that was varied at ten or eleven equispaced levels between black and white were used as symbols and displayed on a uniform white background. Sixteen subjects divided in two groups, participated in the experiment and their task performance times were recorded. We propose a model to describe the process. The perception of lightness is assumed to be an early step in the complex cognitive process to mediate discrimination, and psychophysical laws are used to describe this perceptual mapping. Different mapping schemes are compared by regression on the experimental data. The results show that approximate homogeneity of lightness perception exists in our complex tasks and can be closely described by a blended combination of two opposite power functions assuming either the light end or the dark end of the lightness scale as the starting point.

Most of the results reported in the literature for boundary labeling deal with the so-called one-to-one boundary labeling, i.e., different sites are labelled differently. In certain applications of boundary labeling, however, more than one site may be required to be connected to a common label. In this case, the presence of crossings among leaders often becomes inevitable such that the labeling often has a high degree of confusion in visualization. In this paper, for multi-site-to-one-label boundary labeling, crossings among leaders are avoided by substituting hyperleaders for leaders and by applying dummy labels (i.e., copies/duplicates of labels). Minimizing the number of dummy labels becomes a critical design issue as dummy labels are not required in the initial setting. Therefore, we consider the problem of minimizing the number of dummy labels for multi-site-to-one-label boundary labeling, i.e., finding the placements of labels and hyperleaders such that the total number of dummy labels is minimized and there are no crossings among hyperleaders. Furthermore, after the number of dummy labels is determined, minimizing the total hyperleader length as well as the bends of hyperleaders is also concerned in postprocessing procedure. In this paper, we present polynomial time algorithms for the above one-side and two-side labeling schemes, and show their correctness from a theoretical point of view. In addition, we provide a simulated annealing algorithm for the four-side labeling schemes with objective to minimize the total number of dummy labels as well as the total leader length.

To get insight into the structure and complexity of a data set, we would most preferably just look into it, e.g. by plotting its corresponding point cloud. Unfortunately, for orthogonal scatter plots, this only works up to three dimensions, and other visualizations, like parallel coordinates or scatterplot matrices, also have problems handling many dimensions and visual overlap of data entities. The presented solution tackles the problem of visualizing point clouds indirectly by visualizing the topology of their density distribution. The benefit of this approach is that this topology can be computed in arbitrary dimensions. Similar to examining scatter plots, this gives the important information like the number, size and nesting structure of accumulated regions. We view our approach as an alternative to cluster visualization. To create the visualization, we first estimate the density function using a novel high-dimensional interpolation scheme. Second, we compute that function's topology by means of the join tree, generate a corresponding 3-D terrain using the topological landscape metaphor introduced by Weber et al. {[}36], and finally augment that landscape by placing the original data points at suitable locations.",###,"Patrick Oesterling;Christian Heine;Heike J{\""{a}}nicke;Gerik Scheuermann","Oesterling, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.

The shape descriptor distinguishes three main shape classes: longitudinal, surface-like, and blobby shapes. In contrast to previous approaches, the classification is not performed on a per-voxel level but assigns a uniform shape descriptor to each feature and therefore allows a more intuitive user interface for the assignment of optical properties.

The results of this study show, that depth perception is significantly improved when comparing our illumination model to conventional gradient-based volume shading.

Specifically, a 3D field line whose view-dependent 2D projection is most similar to the user drawing will be identified and utilized to extract all similar 3D field lines. Furthermore, we employ an automatic clustering method to generate field-line templates for the user to locate sub-fields of interest.

They are the direct products of visual exploration and permit construction of insights together with user's mental model and evaluation. Different from the mental model, the type of facts that can be discovered from data is predictable and application-independent. Thus it is possible to develop a general Fact Management Framework (FMF) to allow visualization users to effectively and efficiently annotate, browse, retrieve, associate, and exchange facts. Since facts are essential components of insights, it will be feasible to extend FMF to effective insight management in a variety of visual analytics approaches.

However, in the process of generating 2D images from 3D data, information is lost in the form of attenuation and occlusion. The lack of a feedback mechanism to quantify the loss of information in the rendering process makes the design of good transfer functions a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we present the notion of visibility-driven transfer functions, which are transfer functions that provide a good visibility of features of interest from a given viewpoint. To achieve this, we introduce visibility histograms. These histograms provide graphical cues that intuitively inform the user about the contribution of particular scalar values to the final image. By carefully manipulating the parameters of the opacity transfer function, users can now maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest in a volume data set. Based on this observation, we also propose a semi-automated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively improves a transfer function defined by the user, according to a certain importance metric. Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically.

Our method is low cost with very little storage overhead, and thus facilitates interactive or runtime extraction and visualization, unlike previous methods which were largely suited for hatch-mode processing due to high Computational cost.",###,Chris Muelder;Kwan{-}Liu Ma,"Muelder, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

The massive amount of data collected by the sensor-network terminal are signal-processed by the server and displayed as an organization's topographic map that displays the frequencies of organizational activities. To depict the organization's topographic map, our system creates a novel relation tree using the interaction data from all pairs of members. In this kind of map, some groups in the organization hierarchically form islands. Members in those islands who have relationships with many others form mountains that are plotted with contours.

We present two structure-aware view descriptors, which are the shape view descriptor and the detail view descriptor, to select the optimal viewpoint with the maximum amount of the structural information. These two proposed structure-aware view descriptors are both based on the gradient direction, as the gradient is a well-defined measurement of boundary structures, which have been proved as features of interest in many applications. The shape view descriptor is designed to evaluate the overall orientation of features of interest. For estimating local details, we employ the bilateral filter to construct the shape volume. The bilateral filter is very effective in smoothing local details and preserving strong boundary structures at the same time. Therefore, large-scale global structures are in the shape Volume, while small-scale local details still remain in the original Volume. The detail view descriptor measures the amount of visible details on boundary structures in terms of variances in the local structure between the shape volume and the original volume. These two view descriptors can be integrated into a viewpoint selection framework, and this framework can emphasize global structures or local details with flexibility tailored to the user's specific situations. We performed experiments on various types of volume datasets. These experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed view descriptors, and the proposed viewpoint selection framework actually locates the optimal viewpoints that show the maximum amount of the structural information.",###,Yubo Tao;Hai Lin;Hujun Bao;Feng Dong;Gordon Clapworthy,"Lin, H (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab CAD\&CG, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

PacificVis,2009,Visual support for the understanding of simulation processes,10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2009.4906838,###,###,###,###,"Current visualization systems are typically based on the concept of interactive post-processing. This decoupling of data visualization from the process of data generation offers a flexible application of visualization tools. It can also lead, however, to information loss in the visualization. Therefore, a combination of the visualization of the data generating process with the visualization of the produced data offers significant support for the understanding of the abstract data sets as well as the underlying process. Due to the application-specific characteristics of data generating processes, the task requires tailored visualization concepts. In this work, we focus oil the application field of simulating biochemical reaction networks as discrete-event systems. These stochastic processes generate multi-run and multivariate time-series, which are analyzed and compared on three different process levels: model, experiment, and the level of multi-run Simulation data, each associated with a broad range of analysis goals. To meet these challenging characteristics, we present visualization concepts specifically tailored to all three process levels. The fundament of all three visualization concepts is a compact view that relates the multi-run simulation data to the characteristics of the model structure and the experiment. The view provides the visualization at the experiment level. The visualization at the model level coordinates multiple instances of this view for the comparison of experiments. At the level of multi-run simulation data, the views gives an overview oil the data, which can be analyzed in detail in time-series views suited for the analysis goals. Although we derive our visualization concepts for one concrete simulation process, Our general concept of tailoring the visualization concepts to process levels is generally applicable for the Visualization of simulation processes.",###,Andrea Unger;Heidrun Schumann,"Unger, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Rostock, D-2500 Rostock 1, Germany.
