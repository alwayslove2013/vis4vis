In this study, we investigate the effects of a 3D immersive visualization environment compared to a traditional 2D desktop environment on the comprehension of a network's structure. We compare the two visualization environments using three tasks-interpreting network structure, memorizing a set of nodes, and identifying the structural changes-commonly used for evaluating the quality of a mental map in network visualization. The results show that participants were able to interpret network structure more accurately when viewing the network in an immersive environment, particularly for larger networks. However, we found that 2D visualizations performed better than immersive visualization for tasks that required spatial memory.",,"Kotlarek, Joseph;Kwon, Oh-Hyun;Ma, Kwan-Liu;Eades, Peter;Kerren, Andreas;Klein, Karsten;Schreiber, Falk","Kotlarek, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

The quality metrics are based on group theory as well as geometry. More specifically, we introduce two types of symmetry quality metrics for displaying: (1) a single geometric automorphism as a symmetry (axial or rotational) and (2) a group of geometric automorphisms (cyclic or dihedral). We also present algorithms to compute the symmetry quality metrics in O(nlogn) time. We validate our symmetry quality metrics using deformation experiments. We then use the metrics to evaluate existing graph layouts to compare how faithfully they display geometric automorphisms of a graph as symmetries.",,"Meidiana, Amyra;Hong, Seok-Hee;Eades, Peter;Keim, Daniel","Meidiana, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Shared Memory",10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.3756,,###,###,###,"Force-directed algorithms are widely used to generate aesthetically-pleasing layouts of graphs or networks arisen in many scientific disciplines. To visualize large-scale graphs, several parallel algorithms have been discussed in the literature. However, existing parallel algorithms do not utilize memory hierarchy efficiently and often offer limited parallelism. This paper addresses these limitations with BatchLayout, an algorithm that groups vertices into minibatches and processes them in parallel. BatchLayout also employs cache blocking techniques to utilize memory hierarchy efficiently. More parallelism and improved memory accesses coupled with force approximating techniques, better initialization, and optimized learning rate make BatchLayout significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms such as ForceAtlas2 and OpenOrd.

However, applying RL to real-world tasks like robot control is still challenging. Because generating a massive number of samples to train control policies using RL on real robots is very expensive, hence impractical, it is common to train in simulations, and then transfer to real environments. The trained policy, however, may fail in the real world because of the difference between the training and the real environments, especially the difference in dynamics. To diagnose the problems, it is crucial for experts to understand (1) how the trained policy behaves under different dynamics settings, (2) which part of the policy affects the behaviors the most when the dynamics setting changes, and (3) how to adjust the training procedure to make the policy robust. This paper presents DynamicsExplorer, a visual analytics tool to diagnose the trained policy on robot control tasks under different dynamics settings. DynamicsExplorer allows experts to overview the results of multiple tests with different dynamics-related parameter settings so experts can visually detect failures and analyze the sensitivity of different parameters. Experts can further examine the internal activations of the policy for selected tests and compare the activations between success and failure tests. Such comparisons help experts form hypotheses about the policy and allows them to verify the hypotheses via DynamicsExplorer. Multiple use cases are presented to demonstrate the utility of DynamicsExplorer.",,"He, Wenbin;Lee, Teng-Yok;van Baar, Jeroen;Wittenburg, Kent;Shen, Han-Wei","He, WB (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

Apart from the tremendous amount of research efforts devoted to these two problems individually, finding the association between them has attracted increasingly more attention recently. Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN) is one of the most popular models for this problem proposed by Google DeepMind lately, which integrates an unsupervised concept abstraction process and a supervised symbol-concept association process. Despite the outstanding performance of this deep neural network, interpreting and evaluating it remain challenging. Guided by the practical needs from deep learning experts, this paper proposes a visual analytics attempt, i.e., SCANViz, to address this challenge in the visual domain. Specifically, SCANViz evaluates the performance of SCAN through its power of recognition and generation, facilitates the exploration of the latent space derived from both the unsupervised extraction and supervised association processes, empowers interactive training of SCAN to interpret the model's understanding on a particular visual concept.

However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels.

SSR-VFD is the first work that advocates a machine learning approach to generate high-resolution vector fields from low-resolution ones. The core of SSR-VFD lies in the use of three separate neural nets that take the three components of a low-resolution vector field as input and jointly output a synthesized high-resolution vector field. To capture spatial coherence, we take into account magnitude and angle losses in network optimization. Our method can work in the in situ scenario where VFD are down-sampled at simulation time for storage saving and these reduced VFD are upsampled back to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-VFD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several vector field data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation, and two solutions based on CNN and GAN, respectively.",,"Guo, Li;Ye, Shaojie;Han, Jun;Zheng, Hao;Gao, Han;Chen, Danny Z.;Wang, Jian-Xun;Wang, Chaoli","Guo, L (Corresponding Author), Nankai Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.

We define the preservation of critical points as, without any false positive, false negative, or false type change in the decompressed data, (1) keeping each critical point in its original cell and (2) retaining the type of each critical point (e.g., saddle and attracting node). The key to our method is to adapt a vertex-wise error bound for each grid point and to compress input data together with the error bound field using a modified lossy compressor. Our compression algorithm can be also embarrassingly parallelized for large data handling and in situ processing.

In our proposed approach, the data and task behaviors are visualized through a graph with a fine-designed layout, in which node glyphs are dedicated to showing the status of processes and the links represent the data or task transfer between different computation rounds and processes.

PacificVis,2020,Visualization of Unsteady Flow Using Heat Kernel Signatures,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1718,,###,###,###,"We introduce a new technique to visualize complex flowing phenomena by using concepts from shape analysis. Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly. We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional unsteady flows.",,"Jiang, Kairong;Berger, Matthew;Levine, Joshua A.","Jiang, KR (Corresponding Author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.

Numerical data often has uncertainty associated with it. To visualize uncertainty in a rectangular treemap, we identify two conflicting key requirements: (i) to assess the data value of a node in the hierarchy, the area of its rectangle should directly match its data value, and (ii) to facilitate comparison between data and uncertainty, uncertainty should be encoded using the same visual variable as the data, that is, area. We present Uncertainty Treemaps, which meet both requirements simultaneously by introducing the concept of hierarchical uncertainty masks.

A very popular visualization method for displaying such data structures is called ``Tree{''}. So far, there are a variety of Tree visualization methods that have been proposed and most of them can only visualize one hierarchical dataset at a time. Hence, it raises the difficulty of comparison between two or more hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we proposed Pansy Tree which used a tree metaphor to visualize merged hierarchies. We design a unique icon named pansy to represent each merged node in the structure. Each Pansy is encoded by three colors mapping data items from three different datasets in the same hierarchical position (or tree node). The petals and sepal on Pansy are designed for showing each attribute's values and hierarchical information. We also redefine the links in force layout encoded by width and animation to better convey hierarchical information.

To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efficient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system.

In this paper, we discuss the construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses.

PacificVis,2020,"Representing Multivariate Data by Optimal Colors to Uncover Events of
Interest in Time Series Data",10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.9915,,###,###,###,"In this paper, we present a visualization system for users to study multivariate time series data. They first identify trends or anomalies from a global view and then examine details in a local view. Specifically, we train a neural network to project high-dimensional data to a two dimensional (2D) planar space while retaining global data distances. By aligning the 2D points with a predefined color map, high-dimensional data can be represented by colors. Because perceptual color differentiation may fail to reflect data distance, we optimize perceptual color differentiation on each map region by deformation. The region with large perceptual color differentiation will expand, whereas the region with small differentiation will shrink. Since colors do not occupy any space in visualization, we convey the overview of multivariate time series data by a calendar view. Cells in the view are color-coded to represent multivariate data at different time spans. Users can observe color changes over time to identify events of interest.

With the increase of computing power, billions of particles of high space-time fidelity can be simulated by supercomputers. However, limited computer storage can only hold a small subset of the simulation output for analysis, which makes the understanding of the underlying cosmological phenomena difficult. To alleviate the problem, we design an in-situ data reduction method for large-scale unstructured particle data. During the data generation phase, we use a combined k-dimensional partitioning and Gaussian mixture model approach to reduce the data by utilizing probability distributions. We offer a model evaluation criterion to examine the quality of the probabilistic distribution models, which allows us to identify and improve low-quality models. After the in-situ processing, the particle data size is greatly reduced, which satisfies the requirements from the domain experts.

Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results.

The tool allows domain experts to quickly extract information about the snow level, originating from a series of photos acquired by trail cameras. Using linked views, the domain experts can interactively explore and combine this information with other spatial and non-spatial measures, such as temperature or wind speed, to reveal the interplay of periglacial and aeolian processes. An abstracted interactive map of the area indicates the position of measurement spots to facilitate navigation. The design of the tool was made in tight collaboration with geographers, which resulted in an early prototype, tested in the pilot study.

Insertion angle and insertion depth accuracies were measured and analyzed, as well as task completion time and participants' subjectively perceived task difficulty. Results show a clear ranking of visualization concepts across variables. Less consistent results were obtained for the color and indicator scaling factors.

Given that model trust is often built on the understanding of how a model works, the interpretation of DNNs becomes more important, especially in safety-critical applications (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous driving). In this paper, we propose DeepVID, a Deep learning approach to Visually Interpret and Diagnose DNN models, especially image classifiers. In detail, we train a small locally-faithful model to mimic the behavior of an original cumbersome DNN around a particular data instance of interest, and the local model is sufficiently simple such that it can be visually interpreted (e.g., a linear model). Knowledge distillation is used to transfer the knowledge from the cumbersome DNN to the small model, and a deep generative model (i.e., variational auto-encoder) is used to generate neighbors around the instance of interest. Those neighbors, which come with small feature variances and semantic meanings, can effectively probe the DNN's behaviors around the interested instance and help the small model to learn those behaviors.

Despite their versatility and expressiveness in showing data aspects, such as clusters, correlations, and outliers, scatter plots face a main problem. For large and dense data, the representation suffers from clutter due to overplotting. This is often partially solved with the use of density plots. Yet, data overlap may occur in certain regions of a scatter or density plot, while other regions may be partially, or even completely empty. Adequate pixel-based techniques can be employed for effectively filling the plotting space, giving an additional notion of the numerosity of data motifs or clusters. We propose the Pixel-Relaxed Scatter Plots, a new and simple variant, to improve the display of dense scatter plots, using pixel-based, space-filling mappings. Our Pixel-Relaxed Scatter Plots make better use of the plotting canvas, while avoiding data overplotting, and optimizing space coverage and insight in the presence and size of data motifs. We have employed different methods to map scatter plot points to pixels and to visually present this mapping.

Other approaches have been used to implement coordination such as using varying levels of transparency or visual links. We propose to use spatial distortion to contribute a similar effect in multiple views. It is particularly suited to the context of multiple views since it alleviates the lack of screen space by reallocating it based on a certain definition of user interest. The proposed method targets coordination between views that represent the same entities and readily adapts to various visualization forms. It is based on a user degree-of-interest function, defined on these entities, that acts as a common ground for the distortion of all views.

For synchronous co-located collaboration, a well-recognized challenge is to deliver different contents to people with different privileges and different responsibilities. This challenge is becoming more obvious with the use of a shared display space such as a wall-size display. In particular, scenarios often arise that a privileged participant needs to access sensitive information that other participants are not permitted to view. This is nearly impossible to achieve with only a single display. As a result, it becomes clear that additional devices are needed to provide some of the participants the capability to access and manage certain information in a private space. In this work, we investigate incorporating optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) with a wall-size display to deliver sensitive information in a synchronous co-located, collaborative setting. With our prototype system, we conduct a user study to observe the collaboration styles under this unique setup.

It has been a consistent pursuit to conduct interactive deformation by operations that are natural to users. In this paper, we propose a deformation system following the object-in-hand metaphor. We utilize a touchscreen to directly manipulate the shape of the data by using fingers. Users can drag data features and move them along with the fingers. Users can also press their fingers to hold other parts of the data fixed during the deformation, or perform cutting on the data using a finger. The deformation is executed using a physically-based mesh, which is constructed to incorporate data properties to make the deformation authentic as well as informative. By manipulating data features as if handling an object in hand, we can successfully achieve less occluded view of the data, or improved feature layout for better view comparison.

The geological subsurface is considered as a promising option for the deposition of such by- or end products.

When studying these types of reactions, it is crucial for biochemists to examine trajectories of ligand motion. These trajectories are predicted with in-silico methods that produce large ensembles of possible trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of large sets of ligand trajectories, enabling the domain experts to understand protein function based on the trajectory properties. The proposed solution is composed of multiple linked 2D and 3D views, enabling the interactive exploration and filtering of trajectories in an informed way. In the workflow, we focus on the practical aspects of the interactive visual analysis specific to ligand trajectories. We adapt the small multiples principle to resolve an overly large number of trajectories into smaller chunks that are easier to analyze. We describe how drill-down techniques can be used to create and store selections of the trajectories with desired properties, enabling the comparison of multiple datasets. In appropriately designed 2D and 3D views, biochemists can either observe individual trajectories or choose to aggregate the information into a functional boxplot or density visualization.

For classic Ramachandran Plots, this uncertainty is not propagated when computing the dihedral angles and neglected when visualizing a Ramachandran Plot. To solve this problem, this paper presents an extended version of the Ramachandran Plot, which allows to communicate the uncertainty of atom positions along the computation of dihedral angles and an intuitive visualization. We show the effectiveness of the presented approach by examining different Ramachandran Plots for molecules and show how the inclusion of uncertainty helps biochemistry researchers to determine the stability of a protein with higher accuracy.",,"Maack, Robin G.

In this paper, we present an approach that offers several means to analyze the plot and characters of a novel visually. Analysts can easily switch between an adjacency matrix and a node-link representation, which provide an overview of the characters and the relationships between them. Both views enable analysts to select different text ranges of the novel for studying the commonalities and differences of the character constellations within these ranges. We offer interactive visual representations to help investigate the relationships between the characters in more detail. Additionally, we link the visual representations with the novels' texts to support the inspection and verification of previously generated ideas and hypotheses.

In situ analysis aims at minimizing expensive data movement while maximizing the resource utilization for extraction of important information from the data.

We first propose a table which allows us to explore the design space of composite mappings by offering a systematic overview of channel combinations. We expect that using more than one visual channel for communicating a data attribute increases the bandwidth of information presentation by displaying separable information on different aspects of data. In order to evaluate this point, we compare horizon graph, an existing technique which successfully adopts a composite visual mapping, with a selection of alternative composite mappings. We show that some of those mappings perform as well as - and in some cases even better than-horizon graph in terms of accuracy and speed.

A main drawback of linear layouts are the usually (very) large aspect ratios of the resulting drawings, which prevent users from obtaining a good overview of the whole graph. In this paper we present a novel and versatile algorithm to optimally fold a linear layout of a graph such that it can be drawn effectively in a specified aspect ratio, while still clearly communicating the linearity of the layout. Our algorithm allows vertices to be drawn as blocks or rectangles of specified sizes to incorporate different drawing styles, label sizes, and even recursive structures.

Experimental results using graph sampling quality metrics show that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods produce significantly better results than existing sampling-based proxy graph methods: 25\% improvement by BCP-W and 15\% by BCP-E on average. We also present DBCP, a BC tree-based proxy graph method for distributed environment. Experiments on the Amazon Cloud EC2 demonstrate that DBCP is scalable for big graph data sets; runtime speed-up of 77\% for distributed 5-server on average. Visual comparison using a graph layout method and the proxy quality metrics confirm that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods are significantly better than existing sampling-based proxy graph method. Our main results lead to guidelines for computing sampling-based proxy graphs for visualization of big graphs.",,"Hong, Seok-Hee;Quan Nguyen;Meidiana, Amyra;Li, Jiaxi;Eades, Peter","Hong, SH (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch IT, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Low cost post analysis machines used by scientists to view and analyze these massive datasets are severely limited by their deficiencies in storage bandwidth, capacity, and computational power. Trying to simply move these datasets to these platforms is infeasible. Any approach to view and analyze these datasets on post analysis machines will have to effectively address the inevitable problem of data loss. Image based approaches are well suited for handling very large datasets on low cost platforms. Three challenges with these approaches are how to effectively represent the original data with minimal data loss, analyze the data in regards to transfer function exploration, which is a key analysis tool, and quantify the error from data loss during analysis. We present a novel image based approach using distributions to preserve data integrity. At each view sample, view dependent data is summarized at each pixel with distributions to define a compact proxy for the original dataset.

Certain techniques allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However, in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation of higher-level notions, such as topological features, in order to provide guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or acquired data sets.

In our approach, we allow data duplication in the repartitioning, enabling the same data blocks to be assigned to multiple processes. Load balance is achieved by regularly exchanging the blocks (together with the particles in the blocks) among processes according to the output of the data repartitioning. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms, our approach does not need any preprocessing on the raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently.

A key consideration in this paper is the construction of a cost function to capture several relevant aspects of the human visual system, examining a scatterplot design for some data analysis task. We show how the cost function can be used in an optimizer to search for the optimal visual design for a user's dataset and task objectives (e.g., ``reliable linear correlation estimation is more important than class separation{''}). The approach is extensible to different analysis tasks. To test its performance in a realistic setting, we pre-calibrated it for correlation estimation, class separation, and outlier detection.

Nevertheless, there is currently no established procedure for assessing the condition of the placenta and consequently the fetal health. Due to maternal respiration and inherent movements of the fetus during examination, a quantitative assessment of the placenta requires fetal motion compensation, precise placenta segmentation and a standardized visualization, which are challenging tasks. Utilizing advanced motion compensation and automatic segmentation methods to extract the highly versatile shape of the placenta, we introduce a novel visualization technique that presents the fetal and maternal side of the placenta in a standardized way. Our approach enables physicians to explore the placenta even in utero. This establishes the basis for a comparative assessment of multiple placentas to analyze possible pathologic arrangements and to support the research and understanding of this vital organ. Additionally, we propose a three-dimensional structure-aware surface slicing technique in order to explore relevant regions inside the placenta.

With additional ontology information, the semantics behind the network structure can be further explored. Unfortunately, creating network visualizations with these datasets for presentation can inadvertently expose the private and sensitive information of individuals that reside in the data. To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks.

With DC, users can weigh the relative travel time costs between the origin and potential destinations at a glance because travel times are projected in a linearly interpolated time space from the origin. Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions introduce excessive distortion and challenge user intuition. In addition, there has been little research focusing on DC's user interaction design. To tackle these challenges and realize the potential of DC as an interactive decision-making support tool, we derive a set of useful interactions through two formative studies and devise two novel techniques called Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection and Scalable Road-network Construction. We develop an interactive map system using these techniques and evaluate this system by comparing it against an equidistant map (EM), a widely used conventional layout that preserves the geographical reality. Based on the analysis of user behavior and qualitative feedback, we identify several benefits of using DC itself and of the interaction techniques we derived.

Proposed representations subdivide the dataset into local blocks, where each block holds important statistical information, such as a histogram. A key drawback is that a distribution representing the scalar values in a block lacks spatial information. This manifests itself as large errors in visualization algorithms. We present a novel statistically-based representation by augmenting the block-wise distribution based representation with location information, called a value-based spatial distribution. Information from both spatial and scalar spaces are combined using Bayes' rule to accurately estimate the data value at a given spatial location.

However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.",,"Li, Quan;Shen, Qiaomu;Ming, Yao;Xu, Peng;Wang, Yun;Ma, Xiaojuan;Qu, Huamin","Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \& Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas.

The study entails understanding the state of the Earth's atmosphere, how it is changing over time and why. Understanding how various weather events develop and evolve is often conducted through retrospective analysis of past atmospheric events. Atmospheric scientists can then utilize tools to better predict potential hazards and provide earlier warnings for events that may impact life and property. Several atmospheric state variables can be measured to identify high-impact events, one of which is surface atmospheric pressure. Many weather events are characterized by variations in surface pressure from the mean pressure value (i.e., pressure-perturbations). Accordingly, there is significant interest in extracting and tracking pressure-perturbations both spatially and temporally to better understand the evolution of weather events. Here, we present a visualization and analysis environment that allows interactive exploration of pressure-perturbation data sets. Our system, for the first time, enables atmospheric scientists to interactively explore the spatiotemporal behaviors of pressure-perturbations for a range of values and provides support to leverage other conventional data sets such as radar imagery and wind observations. It also allows atmospheric scientists to evaluate model and parameter sensitivity, which is difficult if not impossible with conventional visualization tools in atmospheric sciences.

As an effective way to visualize and analyze multivariate datasets, volume rendering has been frequently used, although designing good multivariate transfer functions is still non-trivial. In this paper, we present an interactive workflow to allow users to design multivariate transfer functions. To handle large scale datasets, in the preprocessing stage we reduce the number of data points through data binning and aggregation, and then a new set of data points with a much smaller size are generated. The relationship between all pairs of variables is presented in a matrix juxtaposition view, where users can navigate through the different subspaces. An entropy based method is used to help users to choose which subspace to explore. We proposed two weights: scatter weight and size weight that are associated with each projected point in those different subspaces. Based on those two weights, data point filter and kernel density estimation operations are employed to assist users to discover interesting features. For each user-selected feature, a Gaussian function is constructed and updated incrementally. Finally, all those selected features are visualized through multivariate volume rendering to reveal the structure of data. With our system, users can interactively explore different subspaces and specify multivariate transfer functions in an effective way.

Exploring scalar uncertain data modeled as probability distribution fields is a challenging task because the underlying features are often more complex, and the data associated with each grid point are high dimensional. In this work, we present a compact and effective representation, called range likelihood tree, to summarize and explore probability distribution fields. The key idea is to decompose and summarize each complex probability distribution over a few representative subranges by cumulative probabilities, and allow users to consider the roles that different subranges play in understanding the probability distributions. In our method, the value domain is first partitioned into subranges, then the distribution at each grid point is transformed according to the cumulative probabilities of the point's distribution in those subranges. Organizing the subranges into a hierarchical structure based on how these cumulative probabilities are spatially distributed in the grid points, the new range likelihood tree representation allows effective classification and identification of features through user query and exploration. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore probability distribution fields, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework.

This characteristic makes the rendering of mixed-cell unstructured volume efficient.

We present techniques for horizontally displacing the endpoints of line segments in discrete time series data that (1) enable the depiction of subsets of data and (2) reduce occlusion of endpoints. Because endpoints are not displaced vertically, their y values can still be read and compared. Unlike small multiples, our techniques do not move points with the same x or y values far from each other, making some comparison tasks easier. We present three novel techniques: compressed-superposed, compressed-juxtaposed, and shifted layers. One limitation of our techniques is that they work best when there is only a small number of x values being visualized, and additionally, one of them (compressed-superposed) modifies the slopes of curves in a way that makes the slopes incomparable. Our experimental comparison with three status quo techniques (conventional overlaid, vertically-stacked small multiples, and horizontally-stacked small multiples) shows that our proposed techniques are competitive with status quo techniques and in some cases superior.",,"Dumas, Maxime;McGuffin, Michael J.;Chasse, Patrick","Dumas, M (Corresponding Author), Croesus Finansoft, Laval, PQ, Canada.

In order to not spoil or clutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and are associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This labeling technique is known as external label placement. In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions of the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatie analysis of 202 handmade anatomieal drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new geometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important criteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either as hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation is penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach yields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall cost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to deploy our approach in practiee.

This leads to explosively increasing computation costs for analyzing such datasets, thus making formulation and verification of scientific hypotheses very difficult. Therefore, an efficient approach to identifying feature subspaces of target datasets, that is, the subspaces of dimension variables or subsets of the data samples, is required to describe the essence hidden in the original dataset. This paper proposes a visual data mining framework for supporting semiautomatic data analysis that builds upon asymmetric biclustering to explore highly correlated feature subspaces. For this purpose, a variant of parallel coordinate plots, many-to-many parallel coordinate plots, is extended to visually assist appropriate selections of feature subspaces as well as to avoid intrinsic visual clutter. In this framework, biclustering is applied to dimension variables and data samples of the dataset simultaneously and asymmetrically. A set of variable axes are projected to a single composite axis while data samples between two consecutive variable axes are bundled using polygonal strips. This makes the visualization method scalable and enables it to play a key role in the framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been empirically proven, and it is remarkably useful for many-to-many parallel coordinate plots.",,"Wu, Hsiang-Yun;Niibe, Yusuke;Watanabe, Kazuho;Takahashi, Shigeo;Uemura, Makoto;Fujishiro, Issei","Wu, HY (Corresponding Author), Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan.

In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level.

This new visual analytic design interprets the ways through which aggregations are generated with individual layers by interactively splitting and re-constructing the stacked graphs.

We here propose the use of graph invariants to determine suitable parameters automatically. This allows us to perform adaptive filtering to obtain drawings in which the cluster structure is most prominent. The approach is based on an empirical relationship between input and output characteristics that is derived from real and synthetic networks.

Three new concepts are introduced: the distribution of the FTLE (D-FTLE), the FTLE of distributions (FTLE-D), and uncertain LCS (U-LCS). The D-FTLE is the probability density function of FTLE values for every spatiotemporal location, which can be visualized with different statistical measurements. The FTLE-D extends the deterministic FTLE by measuring the divergence of particle distributions. It gives a statistical overview of how transport behaviors vary in neighborhood locations. The U-LCS, the probabilities of finding LCSs over the domain, can be extracted with stochastic ridge finding and density estimation algorithms. We show that our approach produces better results than existing variance-based methods do. Our experiments also show that the combination of D-FTLE, FTLE-D, and U-LCS can help users understand transport behaviors and find separatrices in ensemble simulations of atmospheric processes.",,"Guo, Hanqi;He, Wenbin;Peterka, Tom;Shen, Han-Wei;Collis, Scott M.;Helmus, Jonathan J.","Guo, HQ (Corresponding Author), Argonne Natl Lab, Math \& Comp Sci Div, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.

Discussion",10.1109/TVCG.2016.2534538,,###,###,###,"Vector field topology has been successfully applied to represent the structure of steady vector fields. Critical points, one of the essential components of vector field topology, play an important role in describing the complexity of the extracted structure. Simplifying vector fields via critical point cancellation has practical merit for interpreting the behaviors of complex vector fields such as turbulence. However, there is no effective technique that allows direct cancellation of critical points in 3D. This work fills this gap and introduces the first framework to directly cancel pairs or groups of 3D critical points in a hierarchical manner with a guaranteed minimum amount of perturbation based on their robustness, a quantitative measure of their stability. In addition, our framework does not require the extraction of the entire 3D topology, which contains non-trivial separation structures, and thus is computationally effective. Furthermore, our algorithm can remove critical points in any subregion of the domain whose degree is zero and handle complex boundary configurations, making it capable of addressing challenging scenarios that may not be resolved otherwise.

However, no edge concentration method with the explicit purpose of minimizing the number of edges has previously been studied. In this study, we propose a novel, efficient heuristic method for minimizing the number of edges during edge concentration. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method via a comparison using randomly generated graphs.

Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research.

Reformation",#,,###,###,###,"Comparing time surfaces at different integration time points, or from different seeding areas, can provide valuable insight into transport phenomena of fluid flows. Such a comparative study is challenging due to the often convoluted shapes of these surfaces. We propose a new approach for comparative flow visualization based on time surfaces, which exploits the idea of embedding the surfaces in a carefully designed, reformed 2D visualization space. Such an embedding enables new opportunities for comparative flow visualization. We present three different strategies for comparative flow visualization that take advantage of the reformation. By reforming the time surfaces, we not only mitigate occlusion issues, but we can devote also the third dimension of the visualization space to the comparative aspects of the visualization. Our approach is effective in a variety of flow study cases. The direct comparison of individual time surfaces reveals small scale differences and fine details about the fluid's motion. The concurrent study of multiple surface families enables the identification and the comparison of the most prominent motion patterns. This work was developed in close collaboration with an expert in fluid dynamics, who assessed the potential usefulness of this approach in his field.",,"Brambilla, Andrea;Angelelli, Paolo;Andreassen, Oyvind;Hauser, Helwig","Brambilla, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.

However, none of the currently available techniques provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and precise geometrical based extraction of their structural features performed instantly. In this paper we introduce such a technique enabling the user to compute and also to visualize the molecular surface along with inner voids. To obtain a better insight into the molecule, our technique enables to visualize the molecular surface transparently. The opacity can be adjusted by changing user-defined parameters in order to enhance the perception of the surfaces of inner voids.

Distribution and Associated Uncertainties",#,,###,###,###,"Exploration of atomic trajectories is fundamental to understanding and characterizing complex chemical systems important in many applications. For instance, any new insight into the mechanisms of ionic migration in catalytic materials could lead to a substantial increase in battery performance. A new statistical measure, called the relative-angle distribution, has been proposed to understand complex motion - whether Brownian, ballistic, or diffusive. The relative-angle distribution can be represented as a collection of 1D histograms, but is currently created in a slow, offline process, making any parameter exploration a tedious and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the resulting plot can hide uncertainty in both the data and the visualization. As a result, once rastered or printed at a fixed resolution, these histograms can be misleading. We present a new analysis tool for the exploration of atomic trajectories that combines an interactive histogram visualization with uncertainty information for both data and plotting errors, and is also linked to an interactive 3D display of trajectories. Our tool enables a holistic exploration of trajectories previously not feasible, with the potential for significant scientific impact.

We introduce geo word clouds: word clouds which capture not only the frequency but also the spatial relevance of words. Our input is a set of locations from one (or more) geographic regions with (possibly several) text labels per location. We aggregate word frequencies according to point clusters and employ a greedy strategy to place appropriately sized labels without overlap as close as possible to their corresponding locations. While doing so we ``draw{''} the spatial shapes of the geographic regions with the corresponding labels.

PacificVis,2016,Interactive Visual Co-Cluster Analysis of Bipartite Graphs,#,,###,###,###,"A bipartite graph models the relation between two different types of entities. It is applicable, for example, to describe persons' affiliations to different social groups or their association with subjects such as topics of interest. In these applications, it is important to understand the connectivity patterns among the entities in the bipartite graph. For the example of a bipartite relation between persons and their topics of interest, people may form groups based on their common interests, and the topics also can be grouped or categorized based on the interested audiences. Co-clustering methods can identify such connectivity patterns and find clusters within the two types of entities simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization design that incorporates co-clustering methods to facilitate the identification of node clusters formed by their common connections in a bipartite graph. Besides highlighting the automatically detected node clusters and the connections among them, the visual interface also provides visual cues for evaluating the homogeneity of the bipartite connections in a cluster, identifying potential outliers, and analyzing the correlation of node attributes with the cluster structure. The interactive visual interface allows users to flexibly adjust the node grouping to incorporate their prior knowledge of the domain, either by direct manipulation (i.e., splitting and merging the clusters), or by providing explicit feedback on the cluster quality, based on which the system will learn a parametrization of the co-clustering algorithm to better align with the users' notion of node similarity.

Although using uniformly down-sampled data for visualization is a common practice, important information in the un-stored data can be lost. Currently, linear interpolation is a popular method used to approximate data between the stored time steps. For pathline computation, however, errors from the interpolated velocity in the time dimension can accumulate quickly and make the trajectories rather unreliable. To inform the scientist the error involved in the visualization, it is important to quantify and display the uncertainty, and more importantly, to reduce the error whenever possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm to model temporal interpolation error, and an error reduction scheme to improve the data accuracy for temporally down-sampled data. We show that it is possible to compute polynomial regression and measure the interpolation errors incrementally with one sequential scan of the time-varying flow field. We also show empirically that when the data sequence is fitted with least-squares regression, the errors can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution.

In this work, we propose a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduce spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using point-based methods. We use four existing local vortex detectors and convert their outputs into fuzzy possibility values using a sigmoid-based soft-thresholding approach. We apply a majority voting scheme that enables us to identify candidate vortex regions with a higher degree of confidence. Then, we introduce spatial proximity- based analysis to discern the final vortical regions.

The proposed algorithm is a novel object-based approach which eliminates many of the shortcomings of state-of-the-art image-based DoF algorithms. Based on observations derived from a physically-correct reference renderer, coverage-based opacity estimation exploits semi-transparency to simulate the blur inherent to DoF effects. It achieves high quality DoF effects, by augmenting each atom with a semi-transparent shell, which has a radius proportional to the distance from the focal plane of the camera. Thus, each shell represents an additional coverage area whose opacity varies radially, based on our observations derived from the results of multi-sampling DoF algorithms. By using the proposed technique, it becomes possible to generate high quality visual results, comparable to those achieved through ground-truth multi-sampling algorithms. At the same time, we obtain a significant speedup which is essential for visualizing MD data as it enables interactive rendering. In this paper, we derive the underlying theory, introduce coverage-based opacity estimation and demonstrate how it can be applied to real world MD data in order to achieve DoF effects.

PacificVis,2015,Ray Tracing Within a Data Parallel Framework,#,,###,###,###,"Current architectural trends on supercomputers have dramatic increases in the number of cores and available computational power per die, but this power is increasingly difficult for programmers to harness effectively. High-level language constructs can simplify programming many-core devices, but this ease comes with a potential loss of processing power, particularly for cross-platform constructs. Recently, scientific visualization packages have embraced language constructs centering around data parallelism, with familiar operators such as map, reduce, gather, and scatter. Complete adoption of data parallelism will require that central visualization algorithms be revisited, and expressed in this new paradigm while preserving both functionality and performance. This investment has a large potential payoff: portable performance in software bases that can span over the many architectures that scientific visualization applications run on. With this work, we present a method for ray tracing consisting of entirely of data parallel primitives. Given the extreme computational power on nodes now prevalent on supercomputers, we believe that ray tracing can supplant rasterization as the work-horse graphics solution for scientific visualization. Our ray tracing method is relatively efficient, and we describe its performance with a series of tests, and also compare to leading-edge ray tracers that are optimized for specific platforms. We find that our data parallel approach leads to results that are acceptable for many scientific visualization use cases, with the key benefit of providing a single code base that can run on many architectures.",,"Larsen, Matthew;Meredith, Jeremy S.;Navratil, Paul A.;Childs, Hank","Larsen, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.

If relying too much on effective enhancements in manual interventions, the associated results depend heavily on the knowledge and skills of users performing the data analysis. This paper presents a novel approach to extracting feature subspaces from multivariate data by incorporating biclustering techniques. The approach has been maximally automated in the sense that highly-correlated dimensions are automatically grouped to form subspaces, which effectively supports further exploration of them. A key idea behind our approach lies in a new mathematical formulation of asymmetric biclustering, by combining spherical k-means clustering for grouping highly-correlated dimensions, together with ordinary k-means clustering for identifying subsets of data samples. Lower-dimensional representations of data in feature subspaces are successfully visualized by parallel coordinate plot, where we project the data samples of correlated dimensions to one composite axis through dimensionality reduction schemes. Several experimental results of our data analysis together with discussions will be provided to assess the capability of our approach.",,"Watanabe, Kazuho;Wu, Hsiang-Yun;Niibe, Yusuke;Takahashi, Shigeo;Fujishiro, Issei","Watanabe, K (Corresponding Author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.

The method can be steered towards different degrees of ``curviness{''}: we can encourage or discourage the use of arcs with a large central angle via a single parameter. Our method creates visually pleasing results even for very low output complexities.

In this paper, we introduce FlowString, a novel approach that extracts shape invariant features from streamlines and utilizes a string-based method for exploratory streamline analysis and visualization. Our solution first resamples streamlines by considering their local feature scales. We then classify resampled points along streamlines based on the shape similarity around their local neighborhoods. We encode each streamline into a string of well-selected shape characters, from which we construct meaningful words for querying and retrieval. A unique feature of our approach is that it captures intrinsic streamline similarity that is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Leveraging the suffix tree, we enable efficient search of streamline patterns with arbitrary lengths with the complexity linear to the size of the respective pattern. We design an intuitive interface and user interactions to support flexible querying, allowing exact and approximate searches for robust partial streamline similarity matching. Users can perform queries at either the character level or the word level, and define their own characters or words conveniently for customized search.

The algorithm conserves the original KEGG layout to the extent possible while improving readability by removing unnecessary elements (in organism-specific maps).

Both these achievements were made possible due to the introduction of the concept of control points, which are used in many different multidimensional projection techniques. However, little attention has been drawn towards the process of control points selection. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection technique based on radial basis functions (RBF). Our method uses RBF to create a function that maps the data into a low-dimensional space by interpolating the previously calculated position of control points.

In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell. The particle spacing follows the exponential distribution. In this case, we construct a cumulative distribution function of the particle spacing and develop a technique for calculating the nearest particle along the interval. We apply this technique to multiple volumes to confirm its effectiveness.",,"Sakamoto, Naohisa;Koyamada, Koji","Sakamoto, N (Corresponding Author), Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.

Our system enables the interactive selection of variables that are highly correlated to fish catches recorded by fishermen on their vessels. We illustrate the use of this system using a real-world simulation of the Pacific Ocean. Vortex structures, such as those used for fishing grounds exploration, are crucial for exploring fishing ground because they can drive nutrients from the ocean floor to the sea surface. The ability to locate fishing grounds therefore depends on accurate ocean forecasting systems for calculating ocean model variables such as temperature, salinity, velocity etc. Currently, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations that produce multidimensional and multivariate results. Critical points in the ocean model are good indicators of the likelihood of finding microscale vortices, and our visualization approach enables the interactive exploration and analysis of these critical points. The proposed system makes it possible to analyze the vortex structure in the spatial domain, and explore fishing grounds on the sea surface in detail.",,"Uenaka, Takashi;Sakamoto, Naohisa;Koyamada, Koji","Uenaka, T (Corresponding Author), Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.

PacificVis,2014,2D Vector Field Simplification Based on Robustness,10.1109/PacificVis.2014.17,,###,###,###,"Vector field simplification aims to reduce the complexity of the flow by removing features in order of their relevance and importance, to reveal prominent behavior and obtain a compact representation for interpretation. Most existing simplification techniques based on the topological skeleton successively remove pairs of critical points connected by separatrices, using distance or area-based relevance measures. These methods rely on the stable extraction of the topological skeleton, which can be difficult due to instability in numerical integration, especially when processing highly rotational flows. These geometric metrics do not consider the flow magnitude, an important physical property of the flow. In this paper, we propose a novel simplification scheme derived from the recently introduced topological notion of robustness, which provides a complementary view on flow structure compared to the traditional topologicalskeleton-based approaches. Robustness enables the pruning of sets of critical points according to a quantitative measure of their stability, that is, the minimum amount of vector field perturbation required to remove them. This leads to a hierarchical simplification scheme that encodes flow magnitude in its perturbation metric. Our novel simplification algorithm is based on degree theory, has fewer boundary restrictions, and so can handle more general cases. Finally, we provide an implementation under the piecewise-linear setting and apply it to both synthetic and real-world datasets.",,"Skraba, Primoz;Wang, Bei;Chen, Guoning;Rosen, Paul","Skraba, P (Corresponding Author), Jozef Stefan Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method. We also show how to restrict this type of search to allow only limited back-tracking to provide a heuristic that has better speed and better results than previously known heuristics.",,"Dwyer, Tim;Mears, Christopher;Morgan, Kerri;Niven, Todd;Marriott, Kim;Wallace, Mark","Dwyer, T (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.

The most important structures of fiber reinforced polymers are the individual fibers, as their characteristics (stiffness, strength, ductility, durability, etc.) to a large extent determine the properties of the final component. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new system for interactive exploration and visual analysis of fiber properties in X-ray computed tomography data of fiber reinforced polymers. The presented tool uses parallel coordinates to define and configure initial fiber classes. Using a scatter plot matrix linked to the parallel coordinates the initial classification may be refined. This allows to analyze hidden relationships between individual fiber properties. 2D and 3D views depict the resulting fiber classifications. By using polar plots an intuitive rendering of the fiber orientation distribution is provided. In addition, two modules of higher abstraction are proposed: The Blob visualization creates a hull around fibers with similar characteristics. The fiber metadata visualization allows to calculate overlays for 2D and 3D views containing regional information of particular material characteristics. The proposed system has been evaluated by two groups of domain experts. Applying the presented concepts the user feedback shows that the domain experts are now able to efficiently perform tasks as classification of fibers, visualization of fiber lengths and orientations, and visualization of fiber regions.

Distribution based data summaries can substitute for the raw data to answer statistical queries of different kinds. However, frequent access to the raw data is no longer practical, if possible at all, for answering large number of queries on large-scale data. Our work addresses the issue by accelerating range distribution query, which returns the distribution of an axis-aligned query region. Maintaining the interactivity of such query is a challenging task because the workload and the response time of such queries scale up with the data and the query size. In this paper, we present a framework for answering range distribution queries for any arbitrary region in near constant time, regardless of data and query size. We adapt an integral histogram based data structure to bound the workload which is a combination of computation, I/O and communication cost.

These values are also plotted in 2D graphs for a quantitative time-dependent analysis. For dynamic simulation data sets, the cavities are tracked to show their stability over time. The user is provided with a range of application-related parameters to interactively adjust the analysis algorithms. A sequence diagram shows the structure of the protein and additional annotations like binding sites. Furthermore, all views support brushing and linking for consistent selection and filtering.

To aid their decision making and help them understand how past incidents affected traffic, we propose Traffic Origins, a simple method to visualize the impact road incidents have on congestion. Just before a traffic incident occurs, we mark the incident location with an expanding circle to uncover the underlying traffic flow map and when it ends, the circle recedes. This not only directs attention to upcoming events, but also allows us to observe the impact traffic incidents have on vehicle flow in the immediate vicinity and the cascading effect multiple incidents can have on a road network.

In the circular-arc cartogram model straight-line segments can be replaced by circular arcs in order to modify the areas of the polygons, while the corners of the polygons remain fixed. The countries in circular-arc cartograms have the aesthetically pleasing appearance of clouds or snowflakes, depending on whether their edges are bent outwards or inwards.

This paper presents a novel approach to disoccluding important geographic features when creating 3D urban maps for enhancing their visual readability. This is accomplished by formulating the design criteria as a constrained optimization problem based on the linear programming approach.

PacificVis,2013,Improved Grid Map Layout by Point Set Matching,#,,###,###,###,"Associating the regions of a geographic subdivision with the cells of a grid is a basic operation that is used in various types of maps, like spatially ordered treemaps and OD maps. In these cases the regular shapes of the grid cells allows easy representation of extra information about the regions. The main challenge is to find an association that allows a user to find a region in the grid quickly. We call the representation of a set of regions as a grid a grid map. We introduce a new approach to solve the association problem for grid maps by formulating it as a point set matching problem: Given two sets A (the centroids of the regions) and B (the grid centres) of n points in the plane, compute an optimal one-to-one matching between A and B. We identify three optimisation criteria that are important for grid map layout: maximise the number of adjacencies in the grid that are also adjacencies of the regions, minimise the sum of the distances between matched points, and maximise the number of pairs of points in A for which the matching preserves the directional relation (SW, NW, etc.). We consider matchings that minimise the L-1-distance (Manhattan-distance), the ranked L-1 -distance, and the L-2(2) -distance, since one can expect that minimising distances implicitly helps to fulfill the other criteria. We present algorithms to compute such matchings and perform an experimental comparison that also includes a previous method to compute a grid map. The experiments show that our more global, matching-based algorithm outperforms previous, more local approaches with respect to all three optimisation criteria.",,"Eppstein, David;van Kreveld, Marc;Speckmann, Bettina;Staals, Frank","Eppstein, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.

Changes in sea surface elevation are a good indicator for the movement of loop current eddies, and our visualization approach enables their interactive exploration and analysis.

PacificVis,2013,A Visual Analytics Approach to Exploring Protein Flexibility Subspaces,#,,###,###,###,"Understanding what causes proteins to change shape and how the resulting shape influences function will expedite the design of more narrowly focused drugs and therapies. Shape alterations are often the result of flexibility changes in a set of localized neighborhoods that may or may not act in concert. Computational models have been developed to predict flexibility changes under varying empirical parameters. In this paper, we tackle a significant challenge facing scientists when analyzing outputs of a computational model, namely how to identify, examine, compare, and group interesting neighborhoods of proteins under different parameter sets. This is a difficult task since comparisons over protein subunits that comprise diverse neighborhoods are often too complex to characterize with a simple metric and too numerous to analyze manually. Here, we present a series of novel visual analytics approaches toward addressing this task.

PacificVis,2013,A Generative Layout Approach for Rooted Tree Drawings,#,,###,###,###,"In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic ``meta-layouts{''} have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype.",,"Schulz, Hans-Joerg;Akbar, Zabedul;Maurer, Frank","Schulz, HJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Rostock, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.

In this paper, we introduce the FlowGraph, a novel compound graph representation that organizes streamline clusters and spatial regions hierarchically for occlusion-free and controllable visual exploration. Our approach works with any seeding strategies as long as the domain is well covered and important flow features are captured. By transforming a flow field to a graph representation, we enable observation and exploration of the relationships among streamline clusters, spatial regions and their interconnection in the transformed space. The FlowGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts streamline clusters and spatial regions in various levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides flow field exploration and understanding. Through brushing and linking in conjunction with the spatial streamline view, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowGraph with several visual exploration and comparison tasks that can not be well accomplished using the streamline view alone. As occlusion and clutter are almost ubiquitous in 3D flows, the FlowGraph represents a promising direction for enhancing our ability to understand large and complex flow field data.",,"Ma, Jun;Wang, Chaoli;Shene, Ching-Kuang","Ma, J (Corresponding Author), Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

We propose a region-growing algorithm that extracts the linear neighborhood for a certain position. The region is characterized by linear flow behavior up to a user-defined approximation threshold. While this first method computes the size of a region given the mentioned threshold, our second method computes the quality of a linear approximation given a user-defined n-ring neighborhood. The scalar field resulting from the second method is, therefore, called affine linear approximation error. Isosurfaces of this field show regions of close-to-linear and non-linear flow behavior.

The derivate is an asymmetric tensor field, which allows the deduction of scalar quantities reflecting distinctive field properties like strength of rotation or shear. The basis of the background visualization is a vector and scalar clustering approach. The local features are defined as the extrema of the respective scalar fields.

With a growing volume of data represented as graphs, the problem of understanding and analyzing the variations in a collection of graphs is of increasing importance.

Instead of only merging nodes and edges that are exactly the same, we use domain-specific comparison functions to collapse similar nodes and edges which allows us to generate more compact representations of the collection. In addition, we have developed methods that allow users to interactively control the display of these summary graphs. These interactions include the ability to highlight individual graphs in the summary, control the succinctness of the summary, and explicitly define when specific nodes should or should not be merged. We show that our approach to generating and interacting with graph summaries leads to a better understanding of a graph collection by allowing users to more easily identify common substructures and key differences between graphs.",,"Koop, David;Freire, Juliana;Silva, Claudio T.","Koop, D (Corresponding Author), NYU Poly, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.
